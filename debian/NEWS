ikiwiki (3.20141201) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  By default, this version of IkiWiki tells mobile browsers that its
  layout is suitable for small screens. The default layout and the
  actiontabs, blueview, goldtype and monochrome themes have been adjusted.

  If you have custom CSS that does not work in a small window (a typical
  phone is 320 to 400 CSS pixels wide), please set the new responsive_layout
  config option to 0.

ikiwiki (3.20100515) unstable; urgency=low

  There are two significant changes to the page.tmpl template in this version.
  If you have a locally modified version of that template, you will need to
  update it at least to contain the following in the HTML <head>:

    <TMPL_IF DYNAMIC>
    <TMPL_IF FORCEBASEURL><base href="<TMPL_VAR FORCEBASEURL>" /><TMPL_ELSE>
    <TMPL_IF BASEURL><base href="<TMPL_VAR BASEURL>" /></TMPL_IF>
    </TMPL_IF>
    </TMPL_IF>

  Also, the footer should be wrapped in <TMPL_UNLESS DYNAMIC> ... </TMPL_UNLESS>
  
  There is a new "comment()" pagespec, that can be used to match a
  comment on a page. It is recommended it be used instead of the old
  method of using a pagespec such as "internal(comment_*)" to match
  things that looked like comments. The old pagespec will now also match
  comments that are held for moderation; likely not what you want.

  There have also been some changes to the style.css in this version,
  particularly to support the new openid selector. If you have a modified
  version, of style.css, updating it (or moving it to local.css) is
  recommended.

ikiwiki (3.20100427) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of ikiwiki has a lot of changes that you need to know about.

  Now you can include customised versions of templates in the source
  of your wiki. (For example, templates/page.tmpl.) When these templates
  are changed, ikiwiki will automatically rebuild pages that use them.

  Allowing untrusted users to upload attachments with the ".tmpl"
  extension is not recommended, as that allows anyone to change
  a wiki's templates.

  The --getctime switch is renamed to --gettime, and it also gets the 
  file modification time. And it's a lot faster (when using git). But
  the really important change is, you don't have to remember to use this
  switch. Now ikiwiki will do it when it needs to.

  At last, the "tagged()" pagespec only matches tags, not regular wikilinks.
  If your wiki accidentially relied on the old, buggy behavior, you might
  need to change its pagespecs to use "link()".

  Many of your wishes have been answered: Now tag pages can automatically be
  created when new tags are used. This feature is enabled by default if you
  have configured a tagbase. It can be turned on or off using the
  tag_autocreate setting.

  These changes may also affect some users:

  * The title_natural sort method (as used by the inline directive, etc)
    has been moved to the new sortnaturally plugin, which is not enabled
    by default since it requires the Sort::Naturally perl module.

  * The add_templates option has been removed from the underlay plugin.
    If you used this option, you can instead use templates/ subdirectories
    inside underlay directories added by the add_underlays option.

  Due to the above and other changes, all wikis need to be rebuilt on
  upgrade to this version. If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist
  this will be done automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or
  use ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.

ikiwiki (3.01) unstable; urgency=low

  If your wiki uses git, and you have a `diffurl` configured in
  its setup file, you should be aware that gitweb has stopped
  supporting the url form commonly used for the `diffurl`.

  You can change your setup to use the newer gitweb url form:

    http://git.example.com/gitweb.cgi?p=wiki.git;a=blobdiff;f=[[file]];h=[[sha1_to]];hp=[[sha1_from]];hb=[[sha1_commit]];hpb=[[sha1_parent]]

  The changes from the old form are the addition of the `hpb` parameter,
  and the change to the value used for the `hb` parameter.

ikiwiki (3.00) unstable; urgency=low

  The 3.0 release of ikiwiki changes several defaults and finishes

  TexImg standard preamble changed

  The teximg plugin now has a configurable LaTeX preamble.
  As part of this change the `mchem` LaTeX package has been removed from
  the default LaTeX preamble as it wasn't included in many TeX installations.

  The previous behaviour can be restored by adding the following to your
  ikiwiki setup:

        teximg_prefix => '\documentclass{scrartcl}
                \usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}
                \usepackage{amsmath}
                \usepackage{amsfonts}
                \usepackage{amssymb}
                \pagestyle{empty}
                \begin{document}',

  In addition, the rendering mechanism has been changed to use `dvipng` by
  default, if available.

ikiwiki (2.60) unstable; urgency=low

  Admin preferences are moving from the web interface to the setup file.
  There are three new options in the setup file: `locked_pages`, `banned_users`,
  and `allowed_attachments`. The admin prefs page can still be used, but
  that's deprecated, and the prefs will be hidden if a value is not already
  set. If a value is set in the web interface, you're encouraged to move that
  setting to your setup file now, since version 3.0 will remove the deprecated
  admin prefs web interface.

  Also, the layout of the setup file has changed in a significant way in this
  release. Old setup files will continue to work, but new features, like the
  new websetup interface, require a new format setup file. You can convert
  old setup files into the new format by running 
  `ikiwiki-transition setupformat ikiwiki.setup`

  The search plugin no longer uses hyperestraier. Instead, to use it you
  will now need to install xapian-omega, and the Search::Xapian,
  HTML::Scrubber, and Digest::SHA1 perl modules. Ie,
  `apt-get install xapian-omega libsearch-xapian-perl libhtml-scrubber-perl libdigest-sha1-perl`

  Also, wikis that use the search plugin will need to be rebuilt,
  since the search form has changed. This will not be done automatically,
  but can be done by running `ikiwiki-mass-upgrade` as root, or
  running `ikiwiki -setup` on individual setup files.

  If you allowed password based logins to your wiki, those passwords were
  stored in cleartext in the userdb. To guard against exposing users'
  passwords, I recommend you install the Authen::Passphrase perl module, and
  then run `ikiwiki-transition hashpassword /path/to/srcdir` to replace all
  existing cleartext passwords with strong (blowfish) hashes.

  There were some significant template changes in ikiwiki 2.42 (and 1.33.5).
  If you have locally modified versions of the templates, they need to be
  updated. Most notably, the editpage.tmpl has a new FIELD-SID added to it,
  without which web editing will fail.
 
 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 06 May 2008 14:30:14 -0400

ikiwiki (2.40) unstable; urgency=low

  ikiwiki now has an new syntax for preprocessor directives, using the
  prefix '!':

  [[!directive ...]]

  This new syntax no longer relies on spaces to distinguish between
  wikilinks and preprocessor directives.  Thus, wikilinks can use spaces
  in their link text, and preprocessor directives without arguments (such
  as "toc") need not use a trailing space.

  To enable the new syntax, set prefix_directives to true in your ikiwiki
  config.  For backward compatibility with existing wikis,
  prefix_directives currently defaults to false.  In ikiwiki 3.0,
  prefix_directives will default to true, and wikis which have not yet
  converted to the new syntax will need to set prefix_directives to false
  in their setup files.

  To convert your wiki to the new syntax, ikiwiki provides a new script
  ikiwiki-transition.

  Even with prefix_directives disabled, ikiwiki now allows an optional '!'
  prefix on preprocessor directives (but still requires a space).  Thus, a
  directive which uses a '!' prefix and contains a space will work with
  ikiwiki 2.40 and newer, regardless of the value of prefix_directives.
  This allows the underlay to work with all ikiwikis.

ikiwiki (2.30) unstable; urgency=low

  Ever feel that ikiwiki's handling of RecentChanges wasn't truely in the
  spirit of a wiki compiler? Well, that's changed. The RecentChanges page is
  now a static page, not a CGI. Users can subscribe to its rss/atom feeds.
  Custom RecentChanges pages can be easily set up that display only changes
  to a subset of pages, or only changes by a subset of users.
  
  All wikis need to be rebuilt on upgrade to this version. If you listed your
  wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done automatically when the
  Debian package is upgraded. Or use ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.

  With this excellent new RecentChanges support, the mail notification system
  is its age (and known to be variously buggy and underimplemented for
  various VCSes), and so ikiwiki's support for sending commit mails is REMOVED
  from this version. If you were subscribed to commit mails, you should be
  able to accomplish the same thing by subscribing to a RecentChanges feed.

  The "notify" field in setup files is no longer used, and
  silently ignored. You may want to remove it from your setup file.

  Many of the pages in ikiwiki's basewiki have been moved and renamed in this
  release, to avoid the basewiki including pages with names like "blog".
  Redirection pages have been left behind for these moved pages temporarily,
  and will be removed later.

  If you use the calendar plugin, ikiwiki is now smarter and your nightly
  cron job to update the wiki doesn't need to rebuild everything. Just pass
  --refresh to ikiwiki in the cron job and it will update only pages that
  contain out of date calendars.

ikiwiki (2.14) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of ikiwiki is more picky about symlinks in the path leading
  to the srcdir, and will refuse to use a srcdir specified by such a path.
  This was necessary to avoid some potential exploits, but could potentially
  break (semi-)working wikis. If your wiki has a srcdir path containing a
  symlink, you should change it to use a path that does not.

ikiwiki (2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  Since ikiwiki 2.0 was released, some limitiations have been added to what
  ikiwiki considers a WikiLink. In short, if there are any spaces in between
  the brackets, ikiwiki no longer considers it to be a WikiLink. If your wiki
  contains things meant to be WikiLinks that contain spaces, you will need to
  fix them, by replacing the spaces with underscores.
  
  WikiLink have always been documented to not contain spaces, but bugs in
  ikiwiki made it treat some text with spaces as WikiLinks. Most of these
  bugs were fixed in version 2.2, and a final bug was fixed in this 2.9
  release. These fixes are necessary to avoid ambiguity between
  WikiLinks and PreProcessorDirectives. Apologies for any inconvenience
  these bugs (and their fixes) may have caused.

  In this version the rst plugin allows raw html to be embedded in rst files.

    to wikis that did not have 'usedirs' turned on before, unless you follow
    the procedure described at <http://ikiwiki.info/tips/switching_to_usedirs>,
    or edit your setup file to turn usedirs off:
       usedirs => 0,

  * OpenID logins are now enabled by default, if the Net::OpenID::Consumer
    perl module is available. Password logins are also still enabled
    by default. If you like, you can turn either OpenID or password logins
    off via the 'disable_plugins' setting.

  If your wiki is configured with a setup file, you should modify it to
  stop setting the "plugin" list directly, and instead add or remove plugins
  via the add_plugins and disable_plugins lines. For example, if you had:

  	plugin => [qw{inline smiley search}],

  Change it to these lines, which disables the default htmlscrubber plugin
  and adds the two additional plugins:

  	add_plugins => [qw{smiley search}],
  	disable_plugins => [qw{htmlscrubber}],

  Making this change makes your ikiwiki setup file more future-proof since
  new default plugins will be automatically used.

  There have been several configuration changes in this release of ikiwiki:

  The --svn and --no-svn switches are removed, instead you should use
   --rcs=svn or --no-rcs. ikiwiki setup files that set svn => 1 should
  be changed to set rcs => "svn"; if your setup file sets svn => 0
  then change it to use rcs => "" to disable svn.

  The --hyperestraier switch is gone too. To enable searching, turn on the
  search plugin, by passing --plugin=search or through the plugin setting in
  the setup file.

  The --sanitize and --no-sanitize switches are also gone, replaced with the
  htmlscrubber plugin. This plugin is enabled by default, to disable it,
  use --disable-plugin=htmlscrubber, or modify the plugin setting in the
  setup file.

  Discussion pages are enabled by default, but if your wiki is configured
  with a setup file, you need to edit it to keep them enabled on upgrade
  to this version. Add a line reading:
  discussion => 1,
