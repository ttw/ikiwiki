The ability to post comments depends on several factors:

* `comments_pagespec` controls whether comments on a particular
  page will be displayed
* `comments_closed_pagespec` controls whether comments on
  a particular page are allowed
* the `check_canedit` call controls whether comments are allowed
  for a particular combination of page and user

If `check_canedit` says that a user can post a comment
(in particular, if [[plugins/opendiscussion]] is enabled or
[[plugins/lockedit]] is disabled or permissive),
and `comments_closed_pagespec` does not contradict it,
then users who construct a `do=comment` CGI URL manually
can post comments that will not be displayed. I don't think
this is a security flaw as such, which is why I'm not
reporting it privately, but it violates least-astonishment.

My `ready/comments` branch fixes this, by changing the test
at submission time from (pseudocode)

    !comments_closed_pagespec && check_canedit

to

    comments_pagespec && !comments_closed_pagespec && check_canedit
