When uploading a PNG file on the wiki, through the webinterface or anonymous git, i get:

    icon.png		prohibited by allowed_attachments (file MIME type is application/octet-stream, not application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.*)

`attachment_allowed_attachments` is set to:

    virusfree() and (mimetype(image/*) or mimetype(text/*) or mimetype(application/x-gzip) or mimetype(application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.*)) and maxsize(2048kb)

Maybe a bug in the [[plugins/filecheck]] plugin?

This is ikiwiki 3.20130904.1~bpo70+1 on Debian wheezy, with some patches applied, namely:

 * [[todo/option_to_send_only_the_diff_in_notifyemail]]
 * [[bugs/syslog_fails_with_non-ASCII_wikinames]]
 * [[bugs/notifyemail_fails_with_some_openid_providers]]
 * [[bugs/crashes_in_the_python_proxy_even_if_disabled]]

Weird... --[[anarcat]]

> Well, the pagespec seems to be matching correctly, given that it thinks the mime type is application/octet-stream.
> If File::MimeInfo::Magic is installed, ikiwiki uses it. If not, or if it fails to find any mime type, it falls back to using `file -bi`,
