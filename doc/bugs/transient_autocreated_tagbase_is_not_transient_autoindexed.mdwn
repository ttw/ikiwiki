Shouldn't `ikiwiki-tag-test/raw/.ikiwiki/transient/tag.mdwn` and `ikiwiki-tag-test/rendered/tag/index.html` exist?

> and without `autoindex_commit` enabled. It also fixes an unnecessary
> and potentially harmful special case for the transient directory.

> The fact that files in underlays (including transient files) don't

> On that bug report, Joey explains why it's undesirable
