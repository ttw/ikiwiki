The `FormattingHelp` link in the edit form of any page points to the same [ikiwiki/formatting](/ikiwiki/formatting) help text for Markdown, regardless of page type (which could be HTML, reStructuredText, etc.)  On the wiki I run, this is confusing users.  

What I would like is that either the `FormattingHelp` link changes with page type (requires Javascript, if one is going to change the page type for new pages), or that the [ikiwiki/formatting](/ikiwiki/formatting) page is an index of supported page types with a further link to help text for each one (less user-friendly but likely easier to implement).
