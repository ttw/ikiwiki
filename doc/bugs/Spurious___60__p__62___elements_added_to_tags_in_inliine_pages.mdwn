[[!tag patch]]

When a page containing tags and using the [[syntax_(3rd_party)_plugin|plugins/contrib/syntax]] (though pages using other preprocessors may also be affected) is rendered as an inline page, some extra `<p>` elements are added.

Example output:

    <p><span class="tags">
    Tags:</p>
    
    <p><span class="selflink">XML</span></p>
    
    <p></span></p>

Expected output:

    <p><span class="tags">
    Tags:
    
    <span class="selflink">XML</span>
    </span></p>

A fix is to change inlinepage.tmpl to remove new lines around tag links, as follows:

    --- templates/inlinepage.tmpl   (revision 4626)
    +++ templates/inlinepage.tmpl   (working copy)
