[[!tag patch]]

As noted in the [[!cpan Try::Tiny]] man page, eval/$@ can be quite
awkward in corner cases, because $@ has the same properties and problems
as C's errno. While writing a regression test for definetemplate
in which it couldn't find an appropriate template, I received
    
    <span class="error">Error: failed to process template
    <span class="createlink">deftmpl</span> </span>
    
instead of the intended
    
    <span class="error">Error: failed to process template
    <span class="createlink">deftmpl</span> template deftmpl not
    found</span>
    
which turned out to be because the "catch"-analogous block called
gettext before it used $@, and gettext can call define_gettext,
which uses eval.

Fixed in my branch smcv/ready/careful-eval. Another possibility
for fixing this would be to depend on something like Try::Tiny,
which is already indirectly recommended by ikiwiki, because
[[!cpan RPC::XML]], [[!cpan XML::Feed]], etc., depend on it.
