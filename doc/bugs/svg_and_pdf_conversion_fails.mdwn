[[!template  id=gitbranch branch=chrysn/imgforpdf author="[[chrysn]]"]]

when using the [[img plugin|plugins/img]] with an svg file, it is supposed to
convert it into a png for display in all browsers, and because the typical use
case is rendering small preview versions.

this currently doesn't work (at least with graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat
1.3.18-1) due to the sequence imagemagick options are set, needs an extension
to work for pdfs (or any other imagemagick compatibile file) too, and should
have an additional parameter for page selection.

i've provided a series of [[!taglink patch]]es in the chrysn/imgforpdf [[git]]
branch.

i'd prefer to go a step further, and not only convert pdf and svg files to png,
but everything (with the possible exception of jpg files), as most other image
formats can't be displayed in a browser anyway -- but i didn't in this patch
series, as it would alter the file names of existing images, i don't know if
that needs special care or breaks something i don't use; this way, my patches
should be safe for inclusion.
