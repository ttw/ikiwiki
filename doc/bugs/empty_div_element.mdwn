For some more flexibility in creating a stylesheet for ikiwiki, it would be nice if there were a few unused elements on the page that one can move around and assign content to using CSS.

For instance, something like this:

    <div class='aux' id='aux1'></div>
    <div class='aux' id='aux2'></div>

etc. For bonus points, the number could be configurable. To avoid empty content, style.css should have something like this:

    .aux {
        display: none;
    }

This can then be used to move things around. For instance, I have on my website's CSS stylesheet the following:

    #aux1 {
        position: fixed;
        width: 150px;
        height: 150px;
        bottom: 0px;
        left: 0px;
        background-image: url("wouter3.png");
        background-position: top right;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-origin: content-box;
        display-block;
    }

which adds my hackergochi to the bottom left of the webpage, with some margin.

I tried looking for something like this, but I couldn't find it. Perhaps I just didn't look in the right places, though; apologies if that is the case.
