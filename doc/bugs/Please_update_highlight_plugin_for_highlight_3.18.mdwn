I have put two patches 

     git://pivot.cs.unb.ca/ikiwiki.git -b master

The first works around a highlight API change, and the second supports the new(ish) 
feature of having multiple directories with language defintions for highlight.

The corresponding version of libhighlight-perl is in Debian experimental if you want to test.
