That one has bitten me for some time; here is the minimal testcase.  There is
also an equivalent (I suppose) problem when using another plugin, but I hope
it's enough to track it down for this one.

    $ tar -xj < [bug-dep_order.tar.bz2](http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/ikiwiki/bug-dep_order.tar.bz2)
    $ cd bug-dep_order/
    $ ./render_locally
    [...]
    $ find "$PWD".rendered/ -print0 | xargs -0 grep 'no text was copied'
    $ [no output]
    $ touch news/2010-07-31.mdwn 
    $ ./render_locally 
    refreshing wiki..
    scanning news/2010-07-31.mdwn
    building news/2010-07-31.mdwn
    building news.mdwn, which depends on news/2010-07-31
    building index.mdwn, which depends on news/2010-07-31
    done
    $ find "$PWD".rendered/ -print0 | xargs -0 grep 'no text was copied'
    /home/thomas/tmp/hurd-web/bug-dep_order.rendered/news.html:<p>[[!paste <span class="error">Error: no text was copied in this page</span>]]</p>
    /home/thomas/tmp/hurd-web/bug-dep_order.rendered/news.html:<p>[[!paste <span class="error">Error: no text was copied in this page</span>]]</p>

This error shows up only for *news.html*, but not in *news/2010-07-31* or for
the aggregation in *index.html* or its RSS and atom files.
