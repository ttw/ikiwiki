Similar to [[bugs/syslog_fails_with_non-ASCII_wikinames]], this bug happens when the wiki name has non-ascii characters in the site name. In my case, it has the "Câ’¶TS" string.

We get the following error in a password reset:

    Error: Wide character in subroutine entry at /usr/share/perl5/Mail/Sendmail.pm line 308.

Help! :) --[[anarcat]]
