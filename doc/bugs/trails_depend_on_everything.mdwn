On [[trail's discussion page|plugins/trail/discussion]], [[kjs]] pointed out
that [[plugins/trail]] and [[plugins/contrib/album]] get excessive
dependencies on `internal(*)`. I tracked this down to their (ab)use of
`pagespec_match_list` with the pagespec `internal(*)` to sort a pre-existing
list of pages.

They should just sort the pages instead; they'll already have all the
dependencies they need. My branch adds `IkiWiki::sort_pages` but does not
make it plugin API just yet. --[[smcv]]
