The new regression test from [[plugins/img]] fails when I try to build
ikiwiki in sbuild for a release (with commits from my `img-test` branch
also included, in an attempt to fix this):

    Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at IkiWiki/Plugin/img.pm line 93.
    Use of uninitialized value in numeric lt (<) at IkiWiki/Plugin/img.pm line 110.

    #   Failed test at t/img.t line 78.
    #          got: 'no image'
    #     expected: '12x12'
    
    #   Failed test at t/img.t line 79.
    #          got: 'no image'
    #     expected: '16x2'
    # Looks like you failed 2 tests of 18.
    t/img.t ...................... 
    Dubious, test returned 2 (wstat 512, 0x200)
    Failed 2/18 subtests 

I haven't been able to diagnose what else is wrong there yet.

If anyone needs to release ikiwiki in a hurry, please delete that test
and we can put it back later. --[[smcv]]
