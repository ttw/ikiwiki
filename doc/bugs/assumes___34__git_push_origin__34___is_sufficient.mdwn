[[!tag patch]]

git's behaviour when doing "git push origin" is configurable, and the
default is going to change in 2.0. In particular, if you've set
push.default to "nothing" (the "explicit is better than implicit" option),
the regression test will warn:

    fatal: You didn't specify any refspecs to push, and push.default
    is "nothing".
    'git push origin' failed:  at .../lib/IkiWiki/Plugin/git.pm line 220.

The solution is to do "git push origin master" instead (but with the
configured remote and branch names). --[[smcv]]
