Hey everyone, I have the following problem: I am writing a German Wiki and therefore use umlauts (ä,ö,ü…) quite often in my writing. When I am not using the browser for editing the wiki (or writing comments) everything is fine. Since I want other poeple to be able to post comments or use the discussion pages I need to get the encoding to work. Here is what is happening when I'm trying to edit a discussion page:

* Writing the comment: ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2F3u36261z2N141T343E/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-12%20at%2017.54.06.png)
* Checking the comment via the "preview": ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3O1c2G011u2x0E2s0o3q/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-12%20at%2017.54.17.png)
* Pressing "cancel" since umlauts don't work: ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/141P2M1v323g1J2H3220/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-12%20at%2017.54.30.png)

As I said, when I'm not posting from the browser everything works fine. Here's what I've checked/done to prevent the encoding error:

* I put "export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8" and "export LANGUAGE=de_DE.UTF-8" in my .bashrc
* I set "locale:" to "de_DE.UTF-8" in my ikiwiki .setup-File

What else could there be wrong? What else could I try to solve the problem?

Any ideas are appreciated! Thanks in advance!
