In git master, if `$config{html5} = 1` then the `<base>` URL
will usually be host-relative or protocol-relative (`/wiki/` or
`//example.com/wiki/`) which reduces the need for that option.

This is not yet available in a release, and is still subject to
change.

I still don't know what your wiki's configuration is, because you
never told us the settings I asked for (`cgiurl` and `url`), so
I don't know whether this will help you.
