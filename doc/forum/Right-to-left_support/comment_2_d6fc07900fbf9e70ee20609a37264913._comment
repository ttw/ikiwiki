The Arabic pages on your wiki seem to have the Arabic in LTR, instead of the intended
RTL. The reason may be that the PO plugin does not generate each slave page from scratch,
but rather uses the original page, which causes slave pages to have language 'en' and direction
LTR. I didn't verify this yet. If you do check this, please share results here :)

What I got to work so far is RTL chunks inside LTR pages. It doesn't replace the PO plugin but
it can be used to make PO+RTL work:
