Hi,

You need ikiwiki 3.20140227 or newer, which includes the patch to expose the language code/direction see [[todo/expose_html_language_and_direction/]]
After which you need to modify the templates to make use of the tags.

I'm currently running this on http://addons.nvda-project.org
The config/templates can be [found here](https://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/ikiwiki-ctl)

I haven't investigated how this functions when the po plugin is disabled, but I am guessing that you can simply enable the po plugin, define your master language, and miss out any slave languages.

I would be intrested to hear feedback/what you got to work, as we are a bunch of blind people running the project above, so the correct markup was the goal in our case, I haven't had any feedback on its visual appearance.
