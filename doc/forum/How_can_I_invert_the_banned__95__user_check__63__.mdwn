Trying to lockdown a wiki so that it can only be edited by certain users and figured I'd just set

     banned_users:
     - !user(myadmin)

in my config but it doesn't work.  I'm sure I must be doing something daft?

PS: the user is authenticated via 'httpauth', would that make a difference?

>> That was my initial setup but it wasn't working and I got caught-up on the `banned_user` idea.  It would seem I was getting tricked by some credential-caching-weirdness.  Fired up another browser and `locked_pages` works perfectly.  Thanks.  -- fergus
