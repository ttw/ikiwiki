In my first attempt to edit in a text editor I chose sidebar.mdwn. I committed it  after the editing, and get this when I execute "git push:"

$ git push

I have committed my changes to sidebar.mdwn and given my reason for doing so. Also, I get this complaint about sidebar.mdwn when I try 'git push' after editng other files. So I am stuck here. Pls. help.
