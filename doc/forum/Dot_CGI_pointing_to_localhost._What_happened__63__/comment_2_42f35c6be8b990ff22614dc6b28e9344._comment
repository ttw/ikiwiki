I have added a new `$config{reverse_proxy}` option in git master
which applies the necessary hard-coding.

Also in git master, if `$config{html5} = 1` then the `<base>` URL
will usually be host-relative or protocol-relative (`/wiki/` or
`//example.com/wiki/`) which reduces the need for that option.

These are not yet available in a release, and are still subject to
change.
