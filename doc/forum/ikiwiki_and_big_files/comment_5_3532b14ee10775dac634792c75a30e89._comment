Still struggling with this. Noticed that ikiwiki uses hardlinks to files but copies directory structures if my huge (now 8 gig) media library is added as underlay, but hidden files are ignored, like .htaccess which I use to browse the media files while writing blog posts for example. And symlinks are not supported. At the moment easiest for me would be to use some 'post update' scripts to add a media directory symlink to ikiwiki output directory.
