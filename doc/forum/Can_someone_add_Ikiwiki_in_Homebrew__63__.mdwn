From the latest homebrew, it prompts the following seearch result:

    $ brew search ikiwiki
    No formula found for "ikiwiki".

    Add ikiwiki (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/5355)
    Add ikiwiki formula (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/5358)

Reading the messages on those two GitHub links, it seems the request of adding Ikiwiki into Homebrew is rejected for too much Perl dependencies but an "HomeBrew-Alt" is possible.  Does anyone know if Ikiwiki is added to this "HomeBrew-Alt"?  How to install Ikiwiki on Mac OS X using "Homebrew-Alt"?  I'm desperate in getting Ikiwiki to work on my Mac computers.
