A while ago I added RTL text support to my wiki:

<http://ikiwiki.info/tips/Right-to-left___40__RTL__41___page_text>

But this support does not work with PO files. When I write a page in
English, I need the Hebrew/Arabic translation to have additional text
(in my case, using the template directive) which causes the direction of the
text to be RTL.

I saw a recent patch which claims to solve the problem by exposing the
language code and direction to the templates (which would help a lot), but
when I go to the original website from which it came, it looks like the Arabic
text is still aligned LTR just like English:

<http://addons.nvda-project.org/index.ar.html>

Another issue is that I use Debian stable, and I'm not sure it's safe to
use some unstable ikiwiki (currently I use the version from backports) -
advice welcome :-)

It's still important to have the ability to change direction inside the page,
but the default direction specified either in CSS on in the page.tmpl file
should be dynamic. I didn't check how the PO plugin works, but it may be
necessary to update there, because if all it does is copy the HTML page and
switch strings with translations, it must be modified to also edit the
LTR/RTL directives so that different translations of the same page can have
different directions.

I hope I'll have some time to look into it myself, I'm just a bit behind now
with non-recent ikiwiki version (maybe it's time for me to try sid or from
source).
