I believe that error message indicates that the [[plugins/lockedit]]
plugin is preventing editing. Either make the user account you're
trying to use into a wiki admin via the `adminuser` setting:

    # either or both of these
    adminuser:
    - yourname
    - http://your-openid.example.com/

or allow that user to edit pages by altering the `locked_pages`
setting.
