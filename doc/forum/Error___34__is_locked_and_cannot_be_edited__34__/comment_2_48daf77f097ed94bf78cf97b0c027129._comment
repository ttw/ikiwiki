Thanks. Your prompt reply encouraged me to poke around a bit more. I found a perl module was missing (how I cannot imagine) XML/Writer.pm. Installing the relevant deb seemed to fix things up. 

nb This is a rather old install of ikiwiki. It dates from 2009.

ps Your use of ikiwiki for your homepage is quite impressive, and tasteful!

*Thanks!*
