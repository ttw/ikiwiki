i have no opinion on *whether* there should be different default directories, but *if* new directories are desired, they should go to their respective paths according to [basedir-spec](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/basedir-spec/).

i'm no expert in that, but i think it means that the setup files go to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (`~/.config/ikiwiki/${wikiname_short}.setup`), and srcdir and repository go to `XDG_DATA_HOME` (`~/.local/share/ikiwiki/${wikiname_short}`).
