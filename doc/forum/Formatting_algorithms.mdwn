I'm using ikiwiki for a software project, and in the design process one of the things I sometimes write  
algorithms. It doesn't happen much, but for components of functional nature it's very useful.

I've been thinking how to write them in the wiki. I can use a numbered list and manually make  
keywords __bold__, but it's not optimal. I could also use plain text formatting and indent using tabs,  
but again there is no highlighting of any keywords or formatting of structures.  
Before I do that, I'd like to know if there are better options.

One option I know is LaTeX, which has some very nice packages. You write pseudo-code which looks  
very much like source code, and the result looks great, very readable and high quality.

I saw the [[plugins/teximg]] plugin, but the explanation there is poor: Does the plugin handle things  
that aren't formulas? Could it work with a LaTeX document or with an algorithm environment?

Of course, of you have other suggestions I'll be happy to hear. I want to make a careful choice before  
I start writing many algorithms :-)
