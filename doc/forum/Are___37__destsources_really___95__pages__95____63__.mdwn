In [[plugins/write|plugins/write]] I am told that

> The `%destsources` hash records the name of the source file used to

but that's not what I see happening. I see a hash that maps the output
filename (eg., "foo/index.html") to a source _page_ name (eg., "foo").

I need an additional visit to `%pagesources` to get from "foo"
to "foo.mdwn".

It seems to be consistent and happily working that way, so maybe the
description in [[plugins/write]] is the only mistake. Have I missed something?
