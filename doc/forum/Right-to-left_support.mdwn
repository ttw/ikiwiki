Does ikiwiki support RTL languages? I read somewhere it does, but I don't see
any mention of that here (or anywhere else... that info may be wrong).

I'd like to add RTL support to my wiki, for text direction and maybe for the
page layout too. Before I edit my CSS, page.tmpl and possibly Perl for
automatic direction setting - does ikiwiki support this in any way?

On my wiki (ikiwiki version from Debian 7 stable) everything is aligned to
the left, and unicode RTL characters cannot change that - the .tmpl and
css files would need to be changed, it seems.

I will happily share my insights and code, if I manage to get anything
useful to work :-)
