I'm a horrible person.  Rather than working out what caused the issue I instead setup ikiwiki on Debian Stable (which was going to be my final platform for the server anyway). 

My debugging experience with cgi and webservers is limited, but I will give it another go on my Arch box to see if I can find a resolution.  Other users might be affected by the same issue.
