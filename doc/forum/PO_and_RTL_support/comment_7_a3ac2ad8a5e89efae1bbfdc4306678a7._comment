LTR with embedded RTL, or vice versa, sounds like a job for
the [[tips/Right-to-left___40__RTL__41___page_text]] tip or
something very similar.

> Maybe the direction setting in the CSS also has other effects

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-dir-attribute suggests that the
`dir` attribute is meant to be sufficient, but perhaps it's overridden
by an explict `text-align: left`?

> most of the time what you actually mean is to reverse the direction:
> RTL becomes LTR and vice versa

I don't think \"I know I am switching between English and Arabic,
but I don't know which one I'm currently writing\" is a major use-case :-)

It sounds as though the po plugin is not really what you want, and
you'd be better off with being able to write
`\[[!meta lang=ar dir=rtl]]` or something.
