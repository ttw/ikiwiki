> I saw a recent patch which claims to solve the problem by exposing the language code and direction to the templates

It looks as though you mean [[mhameed]]'s change from
[[todo/expose_html_language_and_direction]], which exposed them to the
templates, but did not modify the default `page.tmpl` to make use
of them. Perhaps you or mhameed could provide a `page.tmpl` patch?
