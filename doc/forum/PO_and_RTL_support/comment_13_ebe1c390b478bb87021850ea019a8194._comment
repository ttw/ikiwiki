> I was told here that there is a patch already

That patch is for the po plugin, which is specifically designed for a wiki
in which every page `foo` is written in a \"master language\" (often English)
in a file like `/foo.mdwn`, and then translated into secondary languages
via translation files like `/foo.ar.po`.

If that doesn't describe your wiki, then the po plugin is not intended
for you, and you would be better off with a change to the meta plugin
to make it possible to emit the same language and/or direction
attributes in the HTML, but triggered by different source code.
