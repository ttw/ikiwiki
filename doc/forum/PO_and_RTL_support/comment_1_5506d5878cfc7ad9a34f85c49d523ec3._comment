HTML5 says:

> Authors are strongly encouraged to use the dir attribute to indicate text direction rather than using CSS, since that way their documents will continue to render correctly even in the absence of CSS (e.g. as interpreted by search engines).

Could you test whether your tip works with `<div dir=\"rtl\">` or something,
please? If it does, please change the tip, if not, we'll have to look at
whether the [[plugins/htmlscrubber]] is getting in the way.

After that, I think the next step towards good RTL support would be to
put together some test-cases for things that are meant to work, in the
form of:

* self-contained source code and setup file for a very simple wiki
* the pages in that wiki making it clear what their intended text
  direction is (e.g. \"this paragraph should be right to left\")

As far as I know, none of the IkiWiki committers can read any RTL
languages, so if you use Arabic or Hebrew or whatever in those
test-cases, we'll need a screenshot/image of what it's meant to look 
like. Using Latin text marked as RTL (so it should come out backwards
if everything is working correctly) might be easier.

The obvious cases that I can think of are:

* the wiki is \"mostly\" in a RTL language
* the master language is LTR but the [[plugins/po]] plugin
  provides a translation into a RTL language

and possibly

* the master language is RTL but the [[plugins/po]] plugin
  provides a translation into a LTR language

It might be necessary to add support for a per-wiki, per-page or
(for po) per-translation-language direction override that would set
the `<html dir>` attribute, but we should find test-cases first, then we
can work out solutions.
