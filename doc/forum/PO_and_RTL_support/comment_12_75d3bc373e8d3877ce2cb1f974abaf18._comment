As to exposing the language tag, I was told here that there is a patch already:

[[/forum/Right-to-left_support/]]

The CSS should requires that I modify my local.css to use the conditional
instead of an \"rtl\" class. For that I need to understand on which items it
affects (and just insert direction=rtl there, like I'm doing now with the class).

When I make the changes in my wiki and test them, I'll send you a patch.
