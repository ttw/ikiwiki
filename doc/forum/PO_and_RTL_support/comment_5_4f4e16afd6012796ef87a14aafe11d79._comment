`<div>` is not specifically preferred, any block-level element will do
(e.g. `<p>`); but `<div>` is something you can wrap around any block,
so it's good for a generic `\[[!template]]`.

The difference between the use of a `dir` attribute and the use
of a `class` attribute is that `dir` has a spec-defined semantic
meaning in HTML4 and HTML5: search engines can look at
`<div dir=\"rtl\">` and know that it is definitely right-to-left.

`<div class=\"rtl\">` *might* mean right-to-left, but it could equally
well mean (for instance) documentation about a run-time library,
or something; classes have no built-in semantic meaning that generic
user-agents like browsers and search engines can rely on.
