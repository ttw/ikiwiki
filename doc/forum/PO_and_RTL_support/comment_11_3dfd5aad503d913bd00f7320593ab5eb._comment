Do you need the po plugin at all? The po plugin is specifically for
sites that are written in a master language (usually English) and
then translated into a bunch of other languages - the same general
approach as <https://www.debian.org/> (that site does not use IkiWiki
but the idea is the same).

If you're selecting languages in some other way -
e.g. all your content is in Arabic except that the `/programming/`
subtree is in English, or something like that - then the po
plugin is not designed for what you're doing, and adding support
for a new meta tag to the meta plugin would be a better way to
get the language code into the header. It could use the same
`TMPL_VAR` hooks in page.tmpl that po does? I'd review a patch.
