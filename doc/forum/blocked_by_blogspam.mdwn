[[!meta title="Wrongfully blocked by blogspam"]]

For a few days, I can no longer post anything on ikiwiki.info using the web interface, but I can still do so using git. Everytime I try to edit a page, I get following message:

    Error: Sorry, but that looks like spam to [[blogspam|http://blogspam.net/]]: Comment rejected by admin.

Does someone know what the problem is?
