I am following the laptop wiki with git tip page. I have set up my local and remote wiki as suggested. However, when I try to push my local changes back to the server I get the following error:

Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 359 bytes, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
cannot write to /home/ian/ianbarton/.ikiwiki/commitlock: No such file or directory
To ian@wilkesley.org:~/ikiwiki/ianbarton.git
   5cf9054..16a871d  master -> master

The relevnt bit of my setup file is:

git_wrapper => '/home/ian/ianbarton.git/hooks/post-commit',

Now ~/ianbarton/.ikiwiki exists and is owned and writable by me. I have tried touching commitlock and also removing lock and commitlock before pushing. Any suggestions for further trouble shooting?

The user is logging as ian, the same user as the laptop. I can push and pull git repos on the same server owned by the same user via ssh with no problem. I have deleted and re-started from scratch several times. However, for my use case I think it's simpler to keep the repo on my local computer and just rsync the web pages to the server.

Ian, you've copied over the repo created by ikiwiki --setup, which contains hook/post-update - just remove that file which is not required anymore on the git server side.
