I can't reproduce this either.

Do you perhaps still have an ikiwiki login session cookie stored in your browser
from when you previously used passwordauth or openid?
(In Firefox: Edit->Preferences, Privacy tab, Show Cookies.)

The login sessions that are considered to be valid are stored in `.ikiwiki/sessions.db`
in your wiki's `srcdir`.
