Hello,

thank you for your comments. The problem comes from the Apache configuration. I use a git-http-backend on this server and I affect the content of the REMOTE_USER environment variable like this:

    SetEnv REMOTE_USER=$REDIRECT_REMOVE_USER

Ikiwiki CGI seems to use this variable to determine which is the current user. Even if the variable content is NULL, ikiwiki.cgi use it.

I just changed this to:

    SetEnvIf Request_URI \"^/git/\" REMOTE_USER=$REDIRECT_REMOVE_USER

and everything runs Ok now...

Sorry for bothering Ikiwikiboard with an HTTP server problem.
