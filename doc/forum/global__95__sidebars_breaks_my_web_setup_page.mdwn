After enabling "Show sidebar on all pages" (global_sidebars) I can no longer access the setup page via the web interface.

The rest of the wiki continues to work, but only "Content-type: text/html" gets sent for this page.

* Fresh ikiwiki --setup of 3.20141016-1 
* Nginx
* EDIT: Arch Linux, built ikiwiki from AUR

Would this be something I'm doing wrong or a bug?
