Maybe someone reading this is able to act on your request. In case that's not true, I'd suggest investigating a few questions on the Homebrew side of things:

7. From Homebrew's 2011 point of view, why did flangy consider [\"large number of perl dependencies\"](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/5358) to be a basis for rejection?
7. From Homebrew's 2014 point of view, is that rationale still considered valid?
7. If so, then does Homebrew make it easy for users to install formulae from repositories other than the official one?
7. If so, then is there an existing non-official repository that either contains an ikiwiki formula or would be willing to accept one?

Since I already use pkgsrc for all my packages (not only ikiwiki) on all my systems (not only OS X), I'm unmotivated to pursue this line of inquiry for possibly zero benefit. If you're already invested in Homebrew, and happy about it, then perhaps it's worth it to you to get this figured out.
