I don't know, but I remember there's a setting in the setup file which sets the extension for Markdown files. I would create a dummy wiki for tests, where I'd create some files with .md extension and change that setting in the setup file. Then try rebuilding the wiki and see what happens.

I'm just a user, I don't know beyond that.
