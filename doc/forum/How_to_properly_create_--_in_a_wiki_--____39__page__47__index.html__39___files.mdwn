I am trying **in a wiki** to "manually," i.e. not using the web interface, use the "page/index.html" type of page creation.

In my working clone src dir I can use, in succession, commands such as:

mkdir MyNewPage

touch MyNewPage/index.mdwn

git add MyNewPage MyNewPage/index.mdwn

[here I edit the new index.mdwn]

git commit -a

git push

These are, roughly, the steps I have taken, and they seem to work. But surely there is a more elegant, **Ikiwiki-ish** solution.
