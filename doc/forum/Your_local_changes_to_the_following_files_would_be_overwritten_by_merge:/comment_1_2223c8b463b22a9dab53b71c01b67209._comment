Just diddling around I got the old copy of sidebar.mdwn out of the way, i.e. I moved it out of, not the .git directory in my home dir, but the \"plain\" one. I really ought to learn the names of these things. At any rate it was what git called my \"local copy,\" so I got it out of there.

Now with the logjam broken I can edit, commit, and push changes, apparently, 'til the cows come home.

Thank yourse A::!
