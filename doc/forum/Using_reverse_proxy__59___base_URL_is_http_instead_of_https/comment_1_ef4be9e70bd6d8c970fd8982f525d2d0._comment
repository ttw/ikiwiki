One way to solve this would be a new `$config{hard_code_urls}`
option whose semantics are \"you're behind a reverse proxy, hard-code
`$config{cgiurl}` and `${url}` in output rather than using the
address from the HTTP request\" (in other words, selectively undo some
of the automatic self-referential URL detection).

Another possibility would be to avoid using `<base>`, and when producing
CGI pages, make all links look like `/sandbox/` or
`/cgi-bin/ikiwiki.cgi?...`; but that can only work if your content and
CGI are on the same domain, and is likely to be more complex.

The `<base href>` is required to be an absolute URI (including the
protocol and domain name) so the CGI output can't avoid doing a certain
amount of hard-coding, unfortunately.
