> One way to solve this would be a new `$config{hard_code_urls}` option

I have added basically this in git master. It isn't in a release yet,
and I renamed it to `$config{reverse_proxy}`.

Also in git master, if `$config{html5} = 1` then the `<base>` URL
will usually be host-relative or protocol-relative (`/wiki/` or
`//example.com/wiki/`) which reduces the need for that option.

These are still subject to change, for now.
