I am not sure to have understood your question, but I assume the following:

- your source wiki contains some subdirectory `blog`;
- you want the whole wiki to be served as [[wiki.example.com]]
- you want the `blog` subdirectory serves as [[blog.example.com]]

If so, what you can do is having two different setup files.

- the first one would contain (using the old setup file format, but you can adapt it for the new one):

      srcdir => \"/path/to/your/source/wiki/\",
      url => \"http://wiki.example.com\",

- and the second one would contain:

      srcdir => \"/path/to/your/source/wiki/blog\",
      url => \"http://blog.example.com\",

I hope I answered your question.
