Thanks, I already saw those.

I need a plugin of exactly the same kind, but which calls other tools, such as Dia and Inkspace.  
In addition, embedding into a page means the same image may end up being generated  
many times. So it's best to generate the image as an attachment of some page, and then  
all other pages in the wiki can use it. What do you think?

Also, if I write a plugin (and test it of course), where do I publish it so people can  
see and enjoy it? Is [[plugins]] moderated?
