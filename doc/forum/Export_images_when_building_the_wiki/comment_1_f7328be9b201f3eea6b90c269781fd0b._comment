Several plugins process data using external programs. You may have a look at:

- [[plugins/teximg]] which calls LaTeX;
- [[plugins/graphviz]] which calls graphviz;
- [[plugins/contrib/pandoc]] which calls pandoc.

The first and second plugins I mentionned create an image using an external
tool, and integrate it in the page. It may be exactly what you want.
