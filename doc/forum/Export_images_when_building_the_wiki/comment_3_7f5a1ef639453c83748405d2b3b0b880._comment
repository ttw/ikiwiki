Then the [[plugins/contrib/pandoc]] may be a good start, since *you can configure it for Pandoc to take over processing of all .mkdn files, or only files with a different extension.* Have a look at it to make your plugin process files with a particular extension. Then, it will be possible to have several pages refer to the same file, generated only once (maybe by storing stuff in `%pagestate` or `%wikistate`.

Have a look at [[plugins/write]] to write your plugin.

What is usually done is:

- you publish your code somewhere (your server, or on github or something like that);
- you advertise your plugin by creating a subpage of [[plugins/contrib]]. Use the [[templates/plugin]] [[template|templates]] (it generates the frame you can see on the right of [[one of my plugins|plugins/contrib/jscalendar]], for example):

      \[[!template id=plugin name=YourFancyPlugin author=\"[[fr33domlover]]\"]]
