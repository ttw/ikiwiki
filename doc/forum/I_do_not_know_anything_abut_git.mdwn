I want to learn how to use a text editor in addition to the web interface. I am stuck on pushing changes back to where they're supposed to go.

I have done:

    git clone Zoidwicky.git Zoidwicky.src

and then, after editing sidebar.mdwn in that new Zoidwicky.src directory

    git commit sidebar.mdwn

Now I believe I must use git push to move that change to I am not sure where.

I learn best by example. Would someone be good enough to post an example of what that 'git push" command might look like?

Here are some samples of what I have tried:

    $ git push sidebar.mdwn Zoidwicky.git
    fatal: Invalid gitfile format: sidebar.mdwn

    $ git push sidebar.mdwn /home/zoid/Zoidwicky.git/
    fatal: remote part of refspec is not a valid name in   /home/zoidberg/Zoidwicky.git
