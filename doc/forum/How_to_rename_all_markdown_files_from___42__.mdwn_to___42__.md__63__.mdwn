Github does not take .mdwn as Markdown files:      https://github.com/github/markup/blob/b865add2e053f8cea3d7f4d9dcba001bdfd78994/lib/github/markups.rb#L1 

I'd like to use filename extensions complaint to GitHub.  My question is after renaming all markdown files from *.mdwn to *.md how do I correct all the dependencies?   Does simply committing the renamed files to the source repository suffice?
