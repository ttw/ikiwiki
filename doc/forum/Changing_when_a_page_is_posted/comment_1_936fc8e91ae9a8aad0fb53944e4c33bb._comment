It does sound as though you have some sort of DST issue going on.
Did you specify the time zone taking into account DST
(e.g. if you are in USA Eastern time (UTC-05:00) and you wrote
a blog post in summer, you'll want to use -0400)?

You don't need to alter the git commit dates, you can use
something like \[[!meta date=\"2014-09-24 08:26:05+0100\"]]
which takes precedence over the commit date from git.
