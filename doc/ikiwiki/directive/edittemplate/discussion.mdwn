For some years now I do feel quite comfortable when using all things *template. But one thing I stumble across when setting up another ikiwiki driven site is a sort of misleading resp. missing description with the [[edittemplate]] directive, where it says "(Don't put the directive on the template page itself)". While this is right there should also be mentioned that "the page holding the edittemplage directive must not be named the same as the template page it refers to". At least with my usual setup the edittemplate directive will not work whenever I attempt to simplify things by giving it the same name as the template page.
