There is an ongoing [effort to standardise Markdown][sm]; I think it would be nice to check whether this implementation is compliant with it.

> any of these, most-preferred first:

> * [[!cpan Text::MultiMarkdown]], only if explicitly requested via
>   `$config{multimarkdown}`
> * [[!cpan Text::Markdown::Discount]], if not explicitly disabled
>   via `$config{nodiscount}`
> * [[!cpan Text::Markdown]]
> * [[!cpan Markdown]]
> * `/usr/bin/markdown`

> In practice, Discount is the implementation pulled in by the
> Debian package dependencies, and (I suspect) the most
> commonly used with IkiWiki.
