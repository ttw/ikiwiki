Ikiwiki is a **wiki compiler**. It converts wiki pages into HTML pages
suitable for publishing on a website. Ikiwiki stores pages and history in a
[[revision_control_system|rcs]] such as [[Subversion|rcs/svn]] or [[rcs/Git]].
There are many other [[features]], including support for
[[blogging|blog]] and [[podcasting|podcast]], as well as a large
array of [[plugins]].

Alternatively, think of ikiwiki as a particularly flexible static
site generator with some dynamic features.

## using ikiwiki

[[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwiki, or you can read the
[[man_page|usage]]. There are some [[examples]] of things you can do
with ikiwiki, and some [[tips]].  Basic documentation for ikiwiki plugins
and syntax is provided [[here|ikiwiki]]. The [[forum]] is open for
discussions.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[sandbox]], so this one does too.

This site generally runs the latest release of ikiwiki; currently, it runs
ikiwiki [[!version ]].
