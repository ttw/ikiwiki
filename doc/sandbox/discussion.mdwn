Whilst discussing Ikiwiki on IRC, someone pointed out that "This is the SandBox, a page anyone can edit to try out ikiwiki" is not strictly true, or is debatably so, since they must log in to edit. This proved to be enough of a barrier that said person didn't consider ikiwiki any further. -- [[Jon]]
