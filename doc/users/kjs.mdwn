Mostly using ikiwiki with the [[/plugins/contrib/album/]] and [[plugins/osm]]
plugins. My git repo with tweaks including the simplebw theme and various
changes to the [[plugins/contrib/album]] plugin and templates can be cloned at:

	git://src.kalleswork.net/ikiwiki.git

Note that the default branch kalleswork.net-current is all my changes piled
into one branch. **I can't code (clone my repo above if you don't believe me!)
so noone should run my code without checking it first.** I can't stress this
enough.

The main changes I've done are the following

* How you browse through the images. The interface i simplified and you click
the image to view the next rather than download it.
* Added separate download link for full resolution image unless size is set to
full in the album directive.
* Extract metadata from exif/xmp data in the image according to preexisting
pattern in the album plugin. This was done using
[Image::ExifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ExifTool.html)
* Autogenerate [[ikiwiki/directive/tag/]]s from exif:Subject if possible.
* Use the albumitem template to create tag pages with thumbnails.
* Additional albumpreview template which allows you to define a thumbnail that
link to the album. Useful for visual index of albums.
* Extract GPS data and populate a [[plugins/osm]] waypoint if available.
* Add span around osm icon to allow for styling.

For my public websites above the image metadata is "manually" ie shell script
populated but I'll eventually start using automatic metadata for new images.

A dump of my debug site with relatively low res images can be found at
<http://src.kalleswork.net/ikidebug/> where the current behavior sans maps can be
tested. Its full of noise so see my proper sites above for how it should look.

* <http://src.kalleswork.net/ikidebug/album01> contains scaled images with
download link
* <http://src.kalleswork.net/ikidebug/album02> contains images with album size
set to "full"
