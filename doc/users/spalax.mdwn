# Plugins

I wrote and maintain a few plugins, which are available here: [[https://atelier.gresille.org/projects/gresille-ikiwiki]].

[[!map pages="plugins/contrib/* and ! plugins/contrib/*/* and author(spalax)"]]

# Wishlist

I have a few things in mind. Their status is something between *I will implement it someday* to *maybe someone could need this* or *I will need it if I implement this killer website I have in mind*.

* [[plugins/contrib/htaccessmanager]]: Create a cgi page to manage a htaccess file.
* Automatically add calendar pages (WIP: see the [[ikiwiki-calendar discussion|ikiwiki-calendar/discussion]]).
