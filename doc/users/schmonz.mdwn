...and uses ikiwiki for all sorts of things:

## Public

* [A major open-source project's wiki](http://wiki.netbsd.org) (with
  the [[rcs/cvs]] plugin)
* [An undergraduate group's university-provided-static-hosted
  site](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/philo/) (with [[plugins/rsync]] and a [WIND
  authentication](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/rad/authmethods/wind/) plugin)
* [A small personal site](http://www.anglofish.net/) (happily hosted at
  [Branchable](http://www.branchable.com/))

## Non-public

* At work, team documentation and project planning: product and sprint
  backlogs, burndown charts, release plans/procedures/announcements,
  aggregating feeds of shared interest, etc.
* On my laptop, personal to-do and scratch space
* [A small personal site](http://podcast.schmonz.com/) (happily hosted at
  [Branchable](http://www.branchable.com/))
