A tag for patches that I would merge if I had commit access to ikiwiki,
in the hope that it's a useful shortlist for committers to look at.
Two categories:

* my own branches, in my git repository under the `ready/*` namespace
* other people's branches, mirrored in my git repo in the same namespace

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(patch) and !link(bugs/done) and
   !link(todo/done) and link(users/smcv/ready) and !*/Discussion"
   archive="yes"]]
