This confuses me enormously. Perhaps because I am new to ikiwiki, to perl, to Linux, etc.

note and popups are templates? But they're not in the templates directory, and in my readings here, templates are supposed to be in the ../templates directory.

Is there a list of the TMPL_VAR-Variables that are defined by ikiwiki?

What I'm trying to achieve is to print the URL of every page on the page itself and therefore I would need the corresponding value in the Template.

Am I missing something?  --[[jwalzer]]

Is there a list of all the available variables somewhere, or do I just grep the source for TMPL_VAR?  And is there a way to refer to a variable inside of a wiki page or does it have to be done from a template?  Thanks. -- [[AdamShand]]

I pulled a list of variables and posted it, its in the history for [[templates]] under my name. [[justint]]

I am trying to override `page.tmpl` by providing `templates/page.tmpl` in my `srcdir`- this works, but now `templates/page.tmpl` is created in my `destdir` as well! Is this expected? Is there a way to avoid this? --chenz
