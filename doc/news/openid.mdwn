Ikiwiki in svn now has support for using [OpenID](http://openid.net), a
decentralized authentication mechanism that allows you to have one login
that you can use on a growing number of websites.

Traditional password-based logins are still supported, but I'm considering
switching at least ikiwiki.info over to using only OpenID logins. 
That would mean blowing away all the currently registered users and
their preferences. If you're active on this wiki, I suggest you log out and
log back in, try out the OpenID signup process if you don't already have an
OpenID, and see how OpenID works for you. And let me know your feelings about
making such a switch. --[[Joey]]
