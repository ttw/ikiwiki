  * Fix crash that can occur when only_committed_changes is set and a
    file is deleted from the underlay.

[ Simon McVittie ]

  * core: avoid dangerous use of CGI->param in list context, which led
    to a security flaw in Bugzilla; as far as we can tell, ikiwiki
    is not vulnerable to a similar attack, but it's best to be safe
  * core: new reverse_proxy option prevents ikiwiki from trying to detect
    how to make self-referential URLs by using the CGI environment variables,
    for instance when it's deployed behind a HTTP reverse proxy
    (Closes: [[!debbug 745759]])
  * core: the default User-Agent is now "ikiwiki/$version" to work around
    ModSecurity rules assuming that only malware uses libwww-perl
  * core: use protocol-relative URLs (e.g. //www.example.com/wiki) so that
    https stays on https and http stays on http, particularly if the
    html5 option is enabled
  * core: avoid mixed content when a https cgiurl links to http static pages
    on the same server (the static pages are assumed to be accessible via
    https too)
  * core: force the correct top URL in w3mmode
  * google plugin: Use search form
  * docwiki: replace Paypal and Flattr buttons with text links
  * comments: don't record the IP address in the wiki if the user is
    logged in via passwordauth or httpauth
  * templates: add ARIA roles to some page elements, if html5 is enabled.
    Thanks, Patrick
  * debian: build-depend on libmagickcore-6.q16-2-extra | libmagickcore-extra
    so we can thumbnail SVGs in the docwiki
  * debian: explicitly depend and build-depend on libcgi-pm-perl
  * debian: drop unused python-support dependency
  * debian: rename debian/link to debian/links so the intended symlinks appear
  * debian: fix some wrong paths in the copyright file
