ikiwiki 3.20140102 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * aggregate: Improve display of post author.
   * poll: Fix behavior of poll buttons when inlined.
   * Fixed unncessary tight loop hash copy in saveindex where a pointer
     can be used instead. Can speed up refreshes by nearly 50% in some
     circumstances.
   * Optimized loadindex by caching the page name in the index.
   * Added only\_committed\_changes config setting, which speeds up wiki
     refresh by querying git to find the files that were changed, rather
     than looking at the work tree. Not enabled by default as it can
     break some setups where not all files get committed to git.
   * comments: Write pending moderation comments to the transient underlay
     to avoid conflict with only\_committed\_changes.
   * search: Added google\_search option, which makes it search google
     rather than using the internal xapain database.
     (googlesearch plugin is too hard to turn on when xapain databases
     corrupt themselves, which happens all too frequently).
   * osm: Remove invalid use of charset on embedded javascript tags.
     Closes: #[731197](http://bugs.debian.org/731197)
   * style.css: Add compatibility definitions for more block-level
     html5 elements. Closes: #[731199](http://bugs.debian.org/731199)
   * aggregrate: Fix several bugs in handling of empty and colliding
     titles when generating filenames."""]]
