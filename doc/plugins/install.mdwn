[[!meta title="Installing third party plugins"]]

Most ikiwiki plugins are perl modules and should be installed somewhere in
the perl module search path. See the @INC list at the end of the output of
`perl -V` for a list of the directories in that path. All plugins are in
the IkiWiki::Plugin namespace, so they go in a IkiWiki/Plugin subdirectory
inside the perl search path. For example, if your perl looks in
`/usr/local/lib/site_perl` for modules, you can locally install ikiwiki
plugins to `/usr/local/lib/site_perl/IkiWiki/Plugin`

You can use the `libdirs` and/or `libdir` configuration options to add
directories to the
search path. For example, if you set `libdir` to `/home/you/.ikiwiki/`,
then ikiwiki will look for plugins in `/home/you/.ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin`.

Ikiwiki also supports plugins that are external programs. These are
typically written in some other language than perl. Ikiwiki searches for
these in `/usr/lib/ikiwiki/plugins` by default. If `libdirs` or `libdir` are
set, it will also look under those directories, for example in
`/home/you/.ikiwiki/plugins`.
Note that this type of plugin has to be executable for ikiwiki to use it.
