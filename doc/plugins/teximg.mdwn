This plugin provides a [[ikiwiki/directive/teximg]] [[ikiwiki/directive]],
that renders LaTeX formulas into images.

You will need LaTeX installed for this to work, specifically something
providing `latex` in the path. You will also need either `dvipng` or a
combination of `dvips` and `convert` from ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick.

On Debian systems, the relevant package names are `texlive-latex-base`
and either `dvipng` or `graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat`.

## configuration

There are several configuration directives that can be used in the setup
file. `teximg_prefix` can be set to change the LaTeX preamble, and
`teximg_postfix` to change the LaTeX postfix. The `teximg_dvipng` setting
can be set to 0 to disable use of `dvipng`, and instead force use of `dvips`
and `convert`.
