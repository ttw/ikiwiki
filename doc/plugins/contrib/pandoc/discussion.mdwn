Does this support ikiwiki-specific idioms like `\[[links]]` or `\[[!macros]]`? I looked at [the readme](https://github.com/sciunto/ikiwiki-pandoc) and it's not quite clear there... --[[anarcat]]

> I don't think it needs to? [[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]] and
> [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]] (what you called "macros") are handled

> > I guess that answers my question by a delicious "yes", thanks! --[[anarcat]]
