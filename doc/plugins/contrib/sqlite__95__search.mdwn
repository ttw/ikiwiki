The [sqlite_search plugin](https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-sqlite_search), available on GitHub, provides a full text search backend for those who, for one reason or another, find it impractical or bothersome to install or configure the Xapian-based backend of the search module which comes with IkiWiki. Practically the only dependency is DBD::SQLite.

It is suitable for small and medium sites in a language written using the Latin alphabet and with a UTF-8 locale.
