I've submitted a couple of patches in [this pull request](https://github.com/jmtd/ikiwiki/pull/1).
The first passes along whatever parameters are being supplied to the pagespec evaluation
(without which, specs like `user(alice)` don't work).

The second changes the "example" returned by `getsetup` to be an actual map, since I saw
that `--dumpsetup` can make use of that to produce a syntactically correct map example
in the YAML config file. An earlier commit comment suggested that once was a problem,
but it doesn't seem to be one now.

Only later did I notice this [[earlier discussion|todo/pagespec_aliases]] suggesting
that the problem with a map might have been in websetup - which I'm not using, so I don't
know if it would still be a problem there.
