[[!tag type/tags]]

This plugin deals with subtags (e.g. `mathematics/calculus`). Whenever a page is tagged, it is automatically tagged with its subtags as well: the following directives are equivalent:

    \[[!tag mathematics/calculus]]
    \[[!tag mathematics mathematics/calculus]]

The `taglink` directive is changed as well: instead of displaying the leaf of the tag, the full path (up to `tagbase` configuration option) is displayed, each bit linking to its corresponding page. For instance, directive `\[[!taglink mathematics/calculus]]` creates a link similar to `\[[TAGBASE/mathematics]]/\[[TAGBASE/mathematics/calculus]]`.
