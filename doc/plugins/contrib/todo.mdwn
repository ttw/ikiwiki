This plugin provides the todo [[ikiwiki/directive]], which enables a page to be marked as a todo page. Additionally a deadline date can be provided.

An example of a page marked as todo could be:

    \[[!todo deadline="3 April 1982"]]
    # Title of what should be done for April 3, 1982
    blabla

This plugin also provides ways to display pages marked as todo, and can even sort those pages by deadline dates:

    \[[!inline pages="* and todo() and !todo(done)" archive="yes" sort="todo(deadline)"]]
