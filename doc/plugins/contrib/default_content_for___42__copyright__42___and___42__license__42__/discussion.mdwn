These plugins do not to work well with reStructuredText pages (and
possibly others).

The issue seems to be that the copyright/licence HTML text is injected
into the page text before the page is converted to HTML.  So, parsers
like reStructuredText which do not allow intermixing their native
format with HTML, will complain.
