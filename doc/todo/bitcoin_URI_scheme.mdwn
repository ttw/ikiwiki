This is a tiny feature request:

add the bitcoin URI scheme [1] to ikiwiki.

This can be done by adding '"bitcoin",' to Ikiwiki/Plugin/htmlscrubber.pm

- 		"aim", "callto", "cvs", "ed2k", "feed", "fish", "gg",
to
+		"aim", "bitcoin", "callto", "cvs", "ed2k", "feed", "fish", "gg",

thanks

> I agree and this was important enough to fire up the ol' wayback machine, set the dial to one year ago today, and fix it then, in version 3.20130212. [[done]]. As a bonus, in this new hardforked casuality chain, someone sent me half a bitcoin using this feature. --[[Joey]]
