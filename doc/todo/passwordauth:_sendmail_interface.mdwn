[[!tag wishlist plugins/passwordauth]]

For sending out password reminder emails, the [[plugins/passwordauth]] plugin currently uses
the *[Mail::Sendmail](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mail::Sendmail)* module.
This module, however, has the limitation that it can only talk *SMPT*,
but can't use the standard Unix *sendmail* (command-line) interface.
I don't want to have an MTA with a SMTPd running on my web server system.
Would it be possible to switch to using one of the existing Perl modules that support
the *sendmail* interface?

From doing a quick search, these might be some candidates:

  * <http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mail::Transport::Sendmail>
  * <http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Send::Sendmail>
  * <http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mail::SendVarious>
  * <http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?EasyMail>

None of them are packaged for Debian so far, but that should be doable easily, as far as I know.

ikiwiki might perhaps even try to use all of them in turn until it finds a working one.

I'd offer to work on a patch for the [[plugins/passwordauth]] plugin and other places
in the ikiwiki source code, where emailing is done.

OK, so I'll have a look at replacing all email handling with *Email::Send*.

[[!tag patch]]
*<http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/ikiwiki/0001-Use-Email-Send-instead-of-Mail-Sendmail.patch>*

Remaining TODOs:

  * Resolve TODOs as denoted inside the patch.
  * Update for the last years of ikiwiki development, such as adapting the
    [[plugins/notifyemail]] plugin.
  * Is this
    [[UTF-8-safe|bugs/password_reset_fails_with___34__Wide_character_in_subroutine_entry__34__]]?
  * Is it worthwhile to use and depend on [[!cpan Return::Value]]
    just for this bit of functionality?
  * Debian news file.
  * ikiwiki news file.

Resent.  --[[tschwinge]]
