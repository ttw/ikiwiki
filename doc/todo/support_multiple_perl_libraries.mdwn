It would be useful to have 

    libdir=>[ qw{libdir1 libdir2 libdir3} ]

as a setup option.  I have a couple of different directories that e.g. come from different git repos, so merging them is a bit messy.

I think the change is a one-liner, but I put this here for discussion before attempting a patch. If some more confident person wants to have a go, feel free.

The ideal place to put it in would be in subroutine [checkconfig](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki.pm;hb=56f8223f9594ae687099dada0c138d669a6f931f#l569). However, plugins are loaded (and option `libdir` is used) in subroutine [loadplugins](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki.pm;hb=56f8223f9594ae687099dada0c138d669a6f931f#l713), which is called [just before `checkconfig`](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=ikiwiki.in;hb=729991564ec7e1116fc023c51e73b47af8b6fce7#l143).
