The `PM_FILTER` doesn't include the `DESTDIR` variable.  This means that, if you use it with your build, it's incoherent to the rest of the build; i.e. the `INSTALLDIR_AUTOREPLACE` doesn't include it.  Honestly I can't recall what the final effect of that was but the following [[patch]] fixed it.

>> Thinking about this more and perhaps this is incorrect?  Or more accurately, I may have been using `DESTDIR` incorrectly.  I'm unsure.  I don't currently have access to the correct build environment but my best recollection is that I was using the `DESTDIR` to set base install directory for multiple working copies.  Of course, the `DESTDIR` is normally a staging install for the root directory (i.e. not normally visible during runtime).  I'm not 100% on the use of `DESTDIR` but perhaps you are?  Otherwise, leave this, and I'll adjust that build environment to rework the `PREFIX` variable instead.  -- [[ttw]]

Also, the `po/Makefile` presumes the use of `make`, explicitly.  If you use another build tool it fails (ironically I was actually using `gmake` in non-gnu environment so it wasn't aliased to `make`).  Switch from the explicit call to the generic recall variable `$(MAKE)`.

>> Yeah, sort of.  I'm not very good with computers ... specifically, with `git` and stuff.  The diff between my `master` and your `master` is only two files so hopefully it *is* actually doing what's intended (that is, those changes are from your repository into my own -- I "rebased" my own in an attempt to simplify things).  Anyway. -- [[ttw]]

> *Pull the 'po/Makefile' change from the mixed-master.*

> This one is adding a $(MAKE) where there was a make. Which is fine, but the commit message is again, horrible. What is the mixed-master? Describe the change you are making, not your internal process for making it.

>> Note to others, `graft` from `hg` doesn't pull original commit messages the way you wish it did (or I did something wrong ... more likely). -- [[ttw]]

> Also, please don't use github pull requests for ikiwiki. Post todo items on ikiwiki.info with a link to your git repository and branches to be merged.

>> NP.  [[http://github.com/ttw/ikiwiki]]; `master` branch. -- [[ttw]]
