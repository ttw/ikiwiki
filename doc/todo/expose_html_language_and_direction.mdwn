When a wiki is translatable, it would be nice to have the language code and the direction of the text exposed as template variables.
This means:

1. Better rendering for rtl languages.
2. Content can correctly be tagged with the language code, to enable screenreaders and other accessibility providers to render/speak the text in the correct language.
