As described on [Tails issue #5879](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5879),
cgit wants URLs like:

        https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/commit/wiki/src/todo/fix_localized_iceweasel_search_engine.mdwn?id=c682a361418bef7bce040ea2905691d54be192ab

... while ikiwiki generates links like:

        https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/commit/wiki/src/todo%2Ffix_localized_iceweasel_search_engine.mdwn?id=c682a361418bef7bce040ea2905691d54be192ab

on the recentchanges page.

Would it make sense to add an option to skip URL-encoding when doing
the substitution of `\[[file]]` in `diffurl` and `historyurl`?
