Thanks a lot Joey. :-)

Hi

I installed version 3.20141016 as described, and it works mostly. However to get [[!iki plugins/sparkline]] to work properly I had to add

[[!format php """
set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/home/private/src/sparkline-php-0.2/lib');
require_once('/home/private/src/sparkline-php-0.2/lib/Sparkline_$style.php');
"""]]

to `sparkline.pm` around line 38. This is mostly likely because

1. I didn't install sparkline into php's default path.
1. I don't really know php.
1. I don't have the time (right now) to sort out the proper way to do this.

I also haven't sorted out how to make [[!iki ikiwiki/directive/format]] fully functional. I suspect I don't have everything installed on the host. -- [[james]]
