because of [[bugs/notifyemail_fails_with_some_openid_providers]], I have been struggling with finding ways of being notified of changes to pages I want to watch here.

the workaround I found so far was to join the `#ikiwiki` channel on freenode, and set the following "hilight" in irssi:

    /hilight -channels #ikiwiki  -word tips/monitor_page_changes_through_IRC

this will watch for any change to this page. -- [[anarcat]]

hello anarcat, I'm editing your page! -- [[micah]]
